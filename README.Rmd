The goal of edwards97 is to implement the Edwards (1997) Langmuir-based semiempirical coagulation model, which predicts the concentration of organic carbon remaining in water after treatment with an Al- or Fe-based coagulant. Methods and example data are provided to optimise empirical coefficients.

This package is experimental, under constant development, and is in no way guaranteed to give accurate predictions (yet).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/edwards97")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(edwards97)

# `edwards_jar_tests` is included
fit_data_alum <- edwards_jar_tests %>% 
  filter(coagulant == "Alum")

# Use TOC measurements as estimates of final DOC
fit_data_alum$DOC_final <- fit_data_alum$TOC_final

# optimise coefficients for this dataset
fit <- fit_edwards_optim(fit_data_alum, initial_coefs = edwards_coefs("alum"))

# view fit results
print(fit)
plot(fit)

```
